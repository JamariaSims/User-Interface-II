            Hello, My name is Jamaria Sims. I'm 27 and I'm currently in school studying full-stack 
            with Lambda. I join Lambda for their learning structure because on my own I would just 
            fall into a bottomless google pit. I currently know some Java/C++/Swift. I like to view 
            coding as magic with my keyboard been my wand. I'm great at problem-solving but sometimes
             can be a perfectionist. I work great with others and great alone. My favorite hobby is actually
              just making things. From apps to games. After Lambda I hope to get a remote job because I would 
              love to work from anywhere but if I couldn't  Atlanta would be my preference. 
        </p>
